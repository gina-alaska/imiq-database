See the protected

branch for older scripts and documentation. The 
contents of the archive branch are not very well documneted, but it contains 
the tools that the previous maintainters of the imiq-database used. The brach 
was creatd before A clean up of the tools, and documentation occured 
in the summer of 2018.
