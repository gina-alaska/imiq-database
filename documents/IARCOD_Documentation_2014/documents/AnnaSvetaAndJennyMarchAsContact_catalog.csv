Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.

The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990).

The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft.

In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.

Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis.

Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990).

The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain.

Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.

Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.

The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters.

Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990).

The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region.

For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter.

Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line.

In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale.

The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters.

Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990.

All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers.

Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record.

Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps.

Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line.

In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale.

The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters.

Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990.

All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers.

Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record.

Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length.

Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line.

In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale.

The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters.

Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990.

All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers.

Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record.

Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres.

Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.

The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990).

The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft.

In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.

Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis.

Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   ,48,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Resources Branch,Inventory information is from John Trawicki and agency report (see citation and source link fields),Trawicki, JM, SM Lyons, and GV Elliot. 1991.

Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990).

Mass exchange -- local net increase or decrease with time of mass in the permanent firn region of the glacier is determined from weekly snow pit studies described in a later section. Daily measurements of precipitation and accumulation or deflation of material by wind permits relating the net change in mass to the ablation or accumulation processes in action. 2. Energy exchange -- Local net increase or decrease with time in thermal energy in the permanent firn region of the glacier is calculated from mass and englacial temperature changes as measured weekly in the snow pits. From conservation of energy principles, it follows that net change in the glacier must equal the net transfer of energy between the glacier and its environment -- in the present case, virtually the net transfer between the glacier and its meteorological environment. During the winter months, net thermal energy transfer will also be calculated using heat flow transducer to measure vertical heat flow in the snow and firn at a shallow depth. Short-wave radiation exchange is measured directly with two Kipp en Zonen solarimeters, one facing upward measuring incoming and one inverted measuring reflected solar radiation. Use of a Mechman and Whitley total hemispheric radiometer to measure net short plus long-wave radiation exchange near the snow surface, and a Beckman Whitley total hemispheric radiometer may permit separation of total net radiation exchange into its original components of incoming short-wave, outgoing short-wave, incoming long-wave, and outgoing long-wave radiation. This separation of radiation terms will allow analysis of the net radiation exchange at the glacier surface as a function of glacier surface temperature, glacier albedo, degree of cloudiness, cloud temperatures, insolation, and vertical distribution of water vapor, CO2, and temperature in the atmosphere. All radiation measurements described above, plus air temperature measurements made at three levels between the glacier surface and 120 cm above, are being recorded automatically and continuously on a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax recorder. Output of a Beckman and Whitley Heat Flow Transducer, buried in the snow, is also recorded on the Speedomax. In addition to these continuously recorded data, observations are made daily at 0800, 12300, 1600, and 2000 of the following: (a) wet and dry bulb temperatures one meter above the surface with an aspirated Assman-type psychrometer (Casela, London). (b) mean density of surface snow and firn through a vertical layer of nineteen cm thickness. © depth and density of new snow.

(e) description of current weather conditions. (f) during special periods: windspeeds at four levels between the surface and 160 cm above the surface with a Thornwaite Wind Profiler Register System. (g) if weather is clear, special solar radiation measurements are made with a Linke-Feusser type actinometer (Kipp en Zonen, Delft) and of diffuse sky radiation with a solarimeter shielded from direct solar radiation.

Mass exchange -- local net increase or decrease with time of mass in the permanent firn region of the glacier is determined from weekly snow pit studies described in a later section. Daily measurements of precipitation and accumulation or deflation of material by wind permits relating the net change in mass to the ablation or accumulation processes in action. 2. Energy exchange -- Local net increase or decrease with time in thermal energy in the permanent firn region of the glacier is calculated from mass and englacial temperature changes as measured weekly in the snow pits. From conservation of energy principles, it follows that net change in the glacier must equal the net transfer of energy between the glacier and its environment -- in the present case, virtually the net transfer between the glacier and its meteorological environment. During the winter months, net thermal energy transfer will also be calculated using heat flow transducer to measure vertical heat flow in the snow and firn at a shallow depth. Short-wave radiation exchange is measured directly with two Kipp en Zonen solarimeters, one facing upward measuring incoming and one inverted measuring reflected solar radiation. Use of a Mechman and Whitley total hemispheric radiometer to measure net short plus long-wave radiation exchange near the snow surface, and a Beckman Whitley total hemispheric radiometer may permit separation of total net radiation exchange into its original components of incoming short-wave, outgoing short-wave, incoming long-wave, and outgoing long-wave radiation. This separation of radiation terms will allow analysis of the net radiation exchange at the glacier surface as a function of glacier surface temperature, glacier albedo, degree of cloudiness, cloud temperatures, insolation, and vertical distribution of water vapor, CO2, and temperature in the atmosphere. All radiation measurements described above, plus air temperature measurements made at three levels between the glacier surface and 120 cm above, are being recorded automatically and continuously on a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax recorder.
