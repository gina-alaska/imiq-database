The SNOTEL data was downloaded on March 20, 2014 from http://www.ambcs.org/dbArchive.htm.  
The timesteps are daily, since Daniel Fischer, at AMBCS, told me that the hourly data does not have QA/QC.  
The data was also downloaded from 'ambcs.org' and not the NRCS SNOTEL site, since Daniel Fischer had told me that not all of the daily parameters are QA/QCed  at NRCS, but they were all QA/QC for AMBCS.

wget -O file --post-data="WaterYear=1966" http://www.ambcs.org/cgi-bin/TKyearSelect.cgi   #to get list of years
wget -O file --post-data="WaterYear=1967" http://www.ambcs.org/cgi-bin/ambcsNames.cgi   # to get list of sites
wget -O file --post-data="WaterYear=1966&site=COLORADO_C_BBM" http://www.ambcs.org/cgi-bin/showWaterYear.cgi  #to retrieve a site file
I did do additionally changes to the data:

1.  Soil Moisture values of 409.0 were set to NULL and a QualifierID was added to indicated the data value was pulled because it was a 409 value.
2.  Water temperature values of -100.0 were set to NULL and a QualifierID was added to indicated the data value was pulled because it was a -100 value.
3.  Wind direction values of -100.0 were set to NULL and a QualifierID was added to indicated the data value was pulled because it was a -100 value.
4.  If the variable header sequence 'fTAC fTAC fTAC fTAC' was found, it was updated to 'fTAC fTAX fTAN fTAA'
5.  Duplicate date ranges for SiteCode '46M05S' were deleted.  Date range was 2010/10/02 to 2010/10/31.
6.  Removed the date '2001/02/29' from the files, since it was not valid.
7.  Removed dates with '/00/', since they were not valid.
8.  Removed dates with '//' since they were not valid.
9.  Deleted a duplicate date range in iSWT, '1989/10/01 to 09/30/1990' for SiteCode 1174.
10. Deleted 2043 years in iPST
11.  Loaded in fTSC,pSMC: 2inches.  fTSD,pSMD: 4inches  fTSE,pSME: 8inches  fTSH,pSMH: 20 inches  pSMI: 40 inches .  Confirmed with Dan Kennedy that this was correct.
12. Replaced 80.1 in the dWDA.txt file with '-99.9'.
