    These SQL scripts are used for creating the summary tables.
The tables were formerly views, and this is the code for creating them,
but with create view replaced with create table.

    The filename describes the table being created. In general they should 
crate a tables.tablename_2 table on the data base. Once tables.tablename_2 
is verified to be correct, delete the original table and rename the new one
