Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector, with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward_air_velocity.)','x_wind','0'
 'Pa m-1','NULL','NULL','\"component_derivative_of_X\" means the derivative of X with respect to distance in the component direction, which may be northward, southward, eastward, westward, x or y. The last two indicate derivatives along the axes of the grid, whether or not they are true longitude and latitude. y_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure means (d/dy) of the ocean surface pressure, as derived by a rigid lid approximation, keeping the other horizontal coordinate (x, presumably) constant.','y_derivative_of_ocean_rigid_lid_pressure','0'
