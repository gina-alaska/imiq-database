QualityControlLevelID,QualityControlLevelCode,Definition,Explanation
-9999,-9999,Unknown,The quality control level is unknown
0,0,Raw data,"Raw and unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone quality control.  Depending on the variable, data type, and data transmission system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after the measurements have been made. Examples include real time precipitation, streamflow and water quality measurements."
1,1,Quality controlled data,Quality controlled data that have passed quality assurance procedures such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published streamflow records following parsing through USGS quality control procedures.
2,2,Derived products,Derived products that require scientific and technical interpretation and may include multiple-sensor data. An example is basin average precipitation derived from rain gages using an interpolation procedure.
3,3,Interpreted products,"Interpreted products that require researcher driven analysis and interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from the combination of rain gages and radar return data."
4,4,Knowledge products,Knowledge products that require researcher driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is percentages of old or new water in a hydrograph inferred from an isotope analysis.
5,0,Instrument Data,"Level 0 data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument/payload data at full resolution; any and all communications artifacts, e.g. synchronization frames, communications headers, duplicate data removed"
6,1A,Instrument Data + Metadata,"Level 1a data products are reconstructed, unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time-referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, e.g., platform ephemeric, computed and appended but not applied to the Level 0 data."
7,1B,Instrument Data in Sensor Units + Metadata,Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units (not all instruments will have a Level 1B equivalent)
8,2,Geophysical Units,Level 2 data products are derived geophysical variables at the same resolution and location as the Level 1 source data.
9,3,Geophysical Units + Space/Time Uniformly Scaled,"Level 3 data products are variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales, usually with some completeness and consistency."
10,4,"Derived Data, from Multiple Variables or from a Model","Level 4 data products are model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g. variables derived from multiple measurements."
