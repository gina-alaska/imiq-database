Lakes that were not surveyed were considered to be too small or too shallow to be considered in the study.  Depth transects were collected on the 2 largest lakes in 1988, 52 of the large lakes in 1989, and 65 lakes in 1990.  Lake locations were identified by legal names and latitude-longitude map coordinates. Note, the lake numbers identified in Elliot (1990) have been changed to include the lake transect data from 1990, thus allowing lakes to be grouped by geographic location. Water depth was measured along a minimum of six transects across each lake, using a recording fathometer mounted on the back of an inflatable boat.  The goal was to run three parallel transects dividing the lake into quarters along one axis. Then three more transects were run perpendicular to t he original transects, also splitting the lake into quarters. Transect configuration was often altered because of irregular shape or size of the lake.  In 1989, several soundings were taken at each lake using a weighted line to develop a calibration factor for the depth recorded by the fathometer.  Sounding depths were read to the nearest 0.1 ft. The depths recorded on the fathometer strip charts were adjusted to true depth soundings using a mylar overlay scribed with the strip chart scale. The overlay scale was placed over the strip chart records and aligned to calibration depth records marked on the strip chart.  The location of each 1 ft depth contour interval was then identified along each transect using the overlay scale (Elliott 1990). In 1990, several depth measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 ft using a weighted line. Soundings taken by fathometer were then calibrated to the measurements of the weighted line. Calibration information was recorded on the strip chart before any transects were run.  Lakes with maximum depths less than 2.5 ft were not measured in the field.  The volumes of these shallow lakes were estimated using surface area measurements from enlarged U.S. Geological Survey maps and maximum depth estimates made by the surveyors.  Lake shoreline maps were made from approximately 9X enlargements of 1:63:000 scale USGS topographic maps. Contour interval locations were placed on lake maps using the proportion of chart transect length to map transect length. Contour lines were drawn on each lake map through corresponding points of depth. The area within each 1 ft contour was read to the nearest 0.001 in^2 using a planimeter. The planimeter reading was then converted to the nearest 1 acre based on the lake map scale. Lake volume was calculated using the formula from Welch (1948): Lake volume = SUM[strata height)/3 * (area of the top of the surface strata  + area of the bottom of the surface strata + Sqrt(area of the top of the surface strata*area of the bottom of the surface strata))], where volume is in acre-ft, height is in ft, and area is in acres. Water volumes in winter were calculated by subtracting 1 ft strata volumes from the ice-free volume to estimate volume of water beneath successive 1 ft layers of ice. Dates that ice thickness reached the 1 ft intervals were approximated from averaged data of ice thickness over time for Barter Island Lake reported by Bilello and Bates (1969, 1971, 1972, and 1975), representing eight years of record. For the purpose of analysis the 1002 area was broken into four geographic regions. Summarizing the data by geographic region illuminates the uneven distribution of lakes across the copastal plain. All lakes surveyed between the Canning and Katakturuk Rivers (lakes #1-43) make up the Canning region. Lakes located between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit River comprise the Katakturuk region (lake #44-45). The Salerochit region (lake #46-79) is located between the Sadlerochit and Jago Rivers. The Jago region extends east from the Jago River, to the Eastern boundary of the 1002 area (lake #80-119). In 1989, each lake was examined for the presence of fish during August. The margins of several lakes were visually inspected to determine the most heavily used shoreline habitat type. All of the lakes were then sampled along selected shoreline areas using a long handled dip net.  All fish captured were identified to species (Elliott 1990). No fish sampling was conducted on lakes during 1990. In 1989, the maximum fetch distance parallel to prevailing wind direction (approximately WSW-ENE) was measured to the nearest 100 ft from enlargements of 1:63,360 scale topographic maps.  The relationship between lake depth and maximum fetch distance was determined using simple linear regression (Elliot 1990).   	http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/fish/Technical_Reports/t_1991_10.pdf

9	North Slope Lakes Project Monthly Lake Chemistry and Physical Data for Selected Lakes, Water and Environmental Research Center, University of Alaska-Fairbanks	Lake sampling for physical and chemical measurements below lake ice occurred monthly from December to May from 2004 to 2008.  Not every lake was visited every month. At each lake, holes were drilled in the ice with an eight to ten inch diameter ice auger. Holes were drilled at the same site on each visit. Water level was determined by surveying from nearby benchmarks. Ice thickness was measured with a folding measuring stick outfitted with a right angle hook for detecting the bottom of the ice. Freeboard was measured from the water surface to the top of ice and water depth was determined with a weighted measuring tape. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity were measured in situ with multiparameter instruments (Troll 9000, Hydrolab Quanta, Hydrolab DataSonde (Hach, Loveland, Colorado). Dissolved oxygen was also measured, at times, with a Hach HQ20 LDO dissolved oxygen meter. The calibration of each meter was checked against calibration solutions before and after sampling. To pass the calibration check, pH had to be within 0.1 pH unit of the calibration standard, conductivity within 10% of the standard, and dissolved oxygen within 10% of saturation when tested in air-bubbled water. Water samples were withdrawn from the lakes through Masterflex silicone tubing from approximately the middle of the unfrozen water column with a peristaltic pump. Filtered samples were pumped through a 0.45 μm Geotech dispos-a-filter (Denver, Colorado). Several liters were flushed through the pump, tubing, and filter before filling 250 ml and 1 l Nalgene HDPE bottles, and 200 ml glass sample bottles. Samples to be analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) and DOC were preserved with phosphoric or sulfuric acid to pH ≤ 2 and stored in glass bottles. Samples to be analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Na, Ca, K, Fe and Mg) were preserved with nitric acid to a pH ≤ 2. Acids were added within hours upon return to the field laboratory. At the field laboratory, raw samples were titrated for alkalinity with bromocresol green-methyl red indicator and a digital titrator with sulfuric acid. Preserved samples were analyzed in a laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Flame atomic absorption in an Analyst 300 (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Massachusetts) was used for Na, Ca, K, Fe, and Mg. An Apollo 9000 TOC analyzer (Tekmar-Dohrmann, Cincinnati, Ohio) was used for TOC and DOC analysis.  Note, that in August of 2005 lake water samples were collected from the shoreline of select lakes.

12	McCall Glacier 1957 and 1958 meteorological and mass balance studies	Observations: 1. Mass exchange -- local net increase or decrease with time of mass in the permanent firn region of the glacier is determined from weekly snow pit studies described in a later section. Daily measurements of precipitation and accumulation or deflation of material by wind permits relating the net change in mass to the ablation or accumulation processes in action. 2. Energy exchange -- Local net increase or decrease with time in thermal energy in the permanent firn region of the glacier is calculated from mass and englacial temperature changes as measured weekly in the snow pits. From conservation of energy principles, it follows that net change in the glacier must equal the net transfer of energy between the glacier and its environment -- in the present case, virtually the net transfer between the glacier and its meteorological environment. During the winter months, net thermal energy transfer will also be calculated using heat flow transducer to measure vertical heat flow in the snow and firn at a shallow depth. Short-wave radiation exchange is measured directly with two Kipp en Zonen solarimeters, one facing upward measuring incoming and one inverted measuring reflected solar radiation. Use of a Mechman and Whitley total hemispheric radiometer to measure net short plus long-wave radiation exchange near the snow surface, and a Beckman Whitley total hemispheric radiometer may permit separation of total net radiation exchange into its original components of incoming short-wave, outgoing short-wave, incoming long-wave, and outgoing long-wave radiation. This separation of radiation terms will allow analysis of the net radiation exchange at the glacier surface as a function of glacier surface temperature, glacier albedo, degree of cloudiness, cloud temperatures, insolation, and vertical distribution of water vapor, CO2, and temperature in the atmosphere. All radiation measurements described above, plus air temperature measurements made at three levels between the glacier surface and 120 cm above, are being recorded automatically and continuously on a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax recorder. Output of a Beckman and Whitley Heat Flow Transducer, buried in the snow, is also recorded on the Speedomax. In addition to these continuously recorded data, observations are made daily at 0800, 12300, 1600, and 2000 of the following: (a) wet and dry bulb temperatures one meter above the surface with an aspirated Assman-type psychrometer (Casela, London). (b) mean density of surface snow and firn through a vertical layer of nineteen cm thickness. © depth and density of new snow. (d) settlement of the snow surface and compaction between the surface and respectively 10, 30, 50, and 70 cm depth as measured on 0.25 inch dowels driven into the snow. (e) description of current weather conditions. (f) during special periods: windspeeds at four levels between the surface and 160 cm above the surface with a Thornwaite Wind Profiler Register System. (g) if weather is clear, special solar radiation measurements are made with a Linke-Feusser type actinometer (Kipp en Zonen, Delft) and of diffuse sky radiation with a solarimeter shielded from direct solar radiation. During the period of the project, additional special measurements will be made of solar radiation penetration into snow, firn, and ice as this penetration related to surface albedo and near-surface temperature distribution and heat flow in the glacier.	
13	Mt Chamberlin and Lake Peters Meteorological measurements 1958-1961 	“Temperature was recorded continuously by thermograph. The following weather elements were recorded and /or observed: global solar radiation, temperature, wet bulb temperature, wind speed and direction, sky cover and ceiling height, precipitation, visibility, and weather and obstructions to visibility.” (de Percin 1959) Observations were collected from May to September of 1958; of this record only the averaged daily temperatures were ever published. The observations continue for April through August of 1959, April of 1960 through August of 1961. The full weather data set for this effort was available only as handwritten daily records on Weather Service weather log sheets, generally three days to a sheet. These were made available through inquiries to John Hobbie (one of the scientists on the team), shipped to Alaska, and transferred to digital files as part of Jenny March's Master's thesis.

28	USFWS Stream Discharge 1988 to 1992	Stream gaging stations were installed between 18 and 20 July 1988. Stream gaging stations were in service until 27 or 28 September 1988. In 1989 stream gaging stations were reinstalled at the 1988 sites with the exception of Itkilyariak Creek. The Itkilyariak Creek stream gage was moved to the West Fork of Itkilyariak Creek.  Two additional gaging stations were installed on the Niguanak and Sikrelurak Rivers. Stations were installed between 14 June and 29 June 1989 and remained in operation until 24 September 1989. Similarly, all 10 gaging stations were reinstalled during the open water months in 1990, 1991, and 1992. Stream gages were installed each spring just after break up when river bottoms were free of anchor ice. Gages were in operation until mid to late September each year.  Rating curves were developed for each stream gage for each year of operation. Polynomial relationships between stage and discharge were developed for all stations except Sadlerochit Springs, where a linear relationship was used. The correlation coefficient for all relationships ranged from 0.95 to 0.99. The average daily discharge for each station for each year was reported.  During five years of data collection bears, ground squirrels, floods, equipment malfunction, and human error resulted in several data gaps. Data gaps were estimated when possible. All estimated data are denoted with an “e”. Estimates of larger data gaps are poor.  When no reasonable method or estimate could be made the data gap was left as missing data. On July 21, 1991, a large flood event washed out the gaging stations on the Sadlerochit and Tamayariak Rivers. A field camp located along the bank of the Sadlerochit River had to be moved because of overbank flooding. Another geology field camp was completely washed away. Estimates of peak flows from this event were estimated using the slope-area method (Darymple et al. 1967). Estimates of discharge during breakup were made using a linear relationship between the USGS data from the Kuparuk River and the river located on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Estimates of the breakup flows are considered to be poor, but are the best professional estimates available. Flood frequency estimates are based on high discharge from precipitation events. Flooding that occurred during breakup was excluded from the analysis. Flood flow frequency analysis was used to calculate flood flow estimates for 2, 5, 10, and 25 year flood frequency events. Flood flow estimates calculated for the Akutoktak, Sadlerochit River, Tamayariak River, and Middle Fork Tamayariak River are based on five years of data. Estimates for West Fork Itkilyariak Creek and Upper West Tamayariak are based on four years of data. No flow estimates were calculated on other creeks. The hydrologic subcommittee (1982) requires a minimum of 10 years of data for flood frequency analysis. The flood flow frequency estimates are based on less than ten years of data and should be used with caution. The relatively high standard deviation is an indication of the low confidence of the flood flow estimates. The annual seven day low flow was calculated for each stream for each year of record.  All low flow calculations are based on the open water season (June through September).

35	TFS_ToolikFieldStation	n June 1988 ARC LTER weather data began to be collected at Toolik Lake (68 degrees 37 42N, 149 degrees 35 46W) by a Campbell 21x datalogger. Hourly averages parameters include: air temperature and relative humidity at, wind speed at, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, net radiation (Fritschen type), unfrozen precipitation, soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth. Net radiation and pan evaporation are only measured during the summer months. The hourly data are in the file 88DLTLH.DAT and daily summaries are in 88DLTLD.DAT. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file 88DLTDAT.ZIP, which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Notes: Wind speed less than .447 is considered calm. For the global solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation sensors no attempt is made to correct for frost or snow on the sensors during the winter months. Therefore winter radiation data should be view as suspect and used only qualitatively. Data was lost from Julian 166 hour 900 to 167 hour 900. At the end of August the 3 meter temperature/ RH sensor was moved up to 5 meters for better separation for the possibility of calculating energy balance using Bowen ratio approach. For the winter, only the 5 meter temperature/RH, wind speed and direction, soil temperature, and lake temperature were recorded. The 5 meter air temperature less then -40 were corrected with a regression of 5 meter air temps verse air TC (only used 0 to -35 for regression). The 5 meter air thermister is only accurate to -40 Celsius. Lake depth was record by a pressure transducer placed offshore in less then 1 meter of water. It was removed during the winter and replaced the following year with a transducer that could be placed deep enough to avoid freezing. Lake temperature during the summer was measured at the depth of the lake depth sensor. The 5 meter direction sensor did not work during the winter. See the Comments variable for additional notes.
