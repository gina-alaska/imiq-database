1	inlandWaters	Distribution and Quantification of Water Within the 1002 Area, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska	An inventory of lake basins in the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was conducted as part of an effort to develop a hydrologic database, map sources of water, and quantify water availability.  Using a recording fathometer, depth profile measurements were taken on 119 lakes within the 1002 area during the summer months of 1988, 1989, and 1990.  Fathometer output was used to construct lake contour maps, calculate volumes, and estimate winter water volumes beneath ice cover.  Total estimated volume of study lakes ranged from 55,382 acre-ft when free of ice to 3,366 acre-ft beneath seven feet of ice, the maximum ice thickness. In April, when ice thickness is at maximum, 90 percent of the available water is contained in nine of the 119 lakes surveyed. The lakes are not evenly distributed across the 1002 area. A large number of lakes are congregated near the mouth of the Canning River, and only two lakes are located in the region between the Katakturuk and Sadlerochit Rivers. During the winter months, winter water is more abundant in lakes than in pools located beneath ice hummocks along major river drainages of the 1002 area. Observation of fish presence in lakes was more frequent and widespread than previously suspected. Ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) were found in 34 of the 52 lakes (65%) surveyed in 1989.

5	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	U.S. Geological Survey: Real-Time Permafrost and Climate Monitoring Network - Arctic Alaska 	The U.S. Geological Survey Real-Time Permafrost and Climate Monitoring Network in Arctic Alaska is a collaborative effort with The Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, private organizations and universities.  Primary network operations are managed by members of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geology and Environmental Change Science Center.  The network was established to provide high quality real-time environmental data to aid in land management decision making.  The information is also used extensively in logistics and aircraft operations. This real-time network is a subset of a larger U.S. Geological Survey permafrost and climate monitoring research network.  Many of the stations are co-located with deep boreholes, thus forming the basis for comprehensive permafrost monitoring observatories.  The objectives of the larger network include climate change detection, monitoring how permafrost and vegetation respond to climate change, and acquiring improved data for current permafrost characterization and impact assessment models. Data from this network contributes to several international networks as well, primarily GTN-P (Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost), part of the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) sponsored effort GCOS (Global Climate Observing System).Time Step for measurement of all variables at automated surface stations is hourly with most sensors being monitored every 30 seconds and averaged every hour and with some sensors sampled once per hour. Provisional data is available from real time stations at http://data.usgs.gov/akcm and/or http://data.usgs.gov/climateMonitoring/alaska/   and/or   http://www.aoos.org/. Select provisional data is available at http://www.gtnp.org/index_e.html  and by personal communication with Frank Urban or Gary Clow.  Borehole TSP data collection began in the late 1970's and since the late 1990's is measured in detail every 5 years and once per year for select sites.

15	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Eddy Flux towers and tundra heating and water manipulation experiments with aerial measur	2000 Summer Field Season Report (lat long of sites are inreport). Investigators: Oechel, Vourlitis, Brooks, Zamolodchikov, Karelin, Stow, Hope. Research sites in Prudhoe Bay, Barrow, Atqasuk, and Seward Peninsula, Alaska, as well as a new site on the Chukotka Peninsula, Russia. Larger scale remote sensing activities have are reported in a previous SDSU Remote Sensing field season report. Tundra Manipulations Experiment -- full factorial heating and water manipulation experiment continued at Barrow, Alaska. Site = 1998-2000. Effective in manipulation of tundra soil temperatures and decreased and increased water table depth. Carbon fluxes in the control plots compare favorably with the eddy covariance tower located several hundred meters away while the manipulated treatments show differences in carbon flux from control plots. Preliminary results: increased soil temperatures increases CO2 uptake. Water table manipulation shows an additive effect on uptake, but appears to have a much weaker effect on fluxes alone and smaller in magnitude than that of increases in temperature. Preliminary NDVI values are higher in the heated plots compared to the controls, indicating possibly enhanced photosynthetic capacity with soil heating. Increases in CO2 uptake seen in the first year of manipulation have continued, with levels similar to those seen in the 1999 growing season.  Tower Based Eddy Covariance -- N Slope: mass, momentum and energy are measured year-round at Prudhoe Bay (1994-2000), Barrow (1997-2000) and Atqasuk (1998-2000). Barrow shows a net growing season sink (June to September) -- this is a decrease in magnitude of the sink strength in 2000 compared to the previous two field seasons. Atqasuk area is typically warmer and drier than Barrow as well as having a different tundra vegetation type. Eddy covariance measurements in Atqasuk show a net source of carbon for June - September. This is a change in direction and magnitude from the 1999 field season; Atqasuk was a very small sink in 1999 for the same time period. Between October-May, data indicate that when summed over the entire year, Arctic tundra ecosystems are a net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Tower Based Eddy Covariance – Seward Peninsula: portable tower was deployed to the Quartz Creek region of the Seward Peninsula between July 25 and August 6. Three sites were measured in the area corresponding to sites selected by Larry Hinzman et al. in which they have established long-term meteorological and hydrological stations and include a young (following fire) and an old tussock tundra site (unburned), as well as a shrub dominated site. The time of the measurements were a few weeks past peak season, and it rained for 5-6 of the 12 days. Measurements between these times shows the young burn site to be a net source of carbon of 0.09 to 0.12 gC d-1, the old tussock tundra was a small net sink of approximately -0.27 to -0.99 gC d-1, and the shrub area having the largest net sink activity of -1.53 to -2.08 gC d-1. Airplane Based Eddy Covariance -- Measurements of mass (CO2, H2O), momentum and energy over large spatial scales were done using our dedicated research aircraft (SDSU Sky Arrow). The Sky Arrow arrived in Prudhoe Bay on 15 June and was flown to Barrow on 18 June. We established three major flux transects which we concentrated on for the entire growing season. The first transect was originally established in 1998 and flown by the NOAA-ATDD Long-EZ, and continued flights in the late season of 1999 by the SDSU Sky Arrow, and continued this year by the SDSU Sky Arrow Environmental Research Aircraft. This transect is approximately 175 km long and begins over the ocean northeast of Barrow and extends 73 km to the south of Atqasuk. The second transect is an East to West transect spanning 80 km from Admirality Bay to Peard Bay. The third transect was flown over Tusivoak Lake, a large freshwater lake 16 km long, located 30 km west-southwest of Barrow. Flux flights were 10 meters above ground level at speeds between 27 to 53 m s-1 (60-112 km hr-1) depending on wind velocity. 185 hours of flight time this season throughout many different weather conditions. Airplane Based Digital Imagery and Spectral Reflectance -- Measurements of spectral reflectance were taken simultaneously with the flux measurements. Particular flights included hyperspectral measurements simultaneous to the flux flights. Additional spectral measurements were taken with the SDSU Sky Arrow with an ADAR spectral imaging system from 3600′ and 7200′ above the Barrow area providing a resolution of 0.5m and 1.0m respectively. The ADAR cameras record four spectral bands (red, green, blue and near-IR) and the images could be constructed in a mosaic for use in AVHRR satellite comparisons. Chamber Based Soil Respiration Measurements --  An attempt this year was made to measure tundra soil respiration using chamber-based techniques. Soil respiration measurements were made within outlying areas of the flux footprint of the eddy covariance towers in Barrow and Atqasuk. Measurements were made once a week for full diurnal measurements at each site. Tundra Vegetation Demography Study --  Dr. Tom Ebert continued his third season of measurements of tundra vegetation demography in Barrow and Atqasuk. Permanent 30m transect lines at Barrow and Atqasuk were resampled using a digital video camera (620 x 480 pixels) mounted on a 3-meter boom. Photographing smaller plots (25 cm x 30 cm) than in 1998 has increased resolution but with an associated increase in the number of pictures that must be analyzed. Each 30 meter transect consists of two bands 25 cm wide, one from 0-25 and the second from 25 to 50cm which gives 200 images per 30 x 0.5m transect. Images from 2000 are paired with 1999 images so changes in individual plants can be measured. Measurements are change in size, which can be either positive or negative, loss (death), or addition of new individuals. Numbers of flowers are counted and provide a measure of size-specific reproduction. Transitions are used in a size-based demographic model to predict rate of population change and to explore the sensitivity and stability characteristics of plant species. There are six original Barrow and five additional Barrow transects (each 10m long) were photographed on the abandoned road at the Old IBP site. There are two sites at Atqasuk, each with three transects. Methane Flux Measurements -- Methane flux measurements were conducted between 12 June and 7 October headed by Dr. Yoshinobu Harazono of Japan’s National Institute of Agro-Environmental Sciences in collaboration with SDSU. Their measurement site is located about 0.8 kilometers to the Southwest of our main eddy covariance tower in Barrow and located in an area called Central Marsh. The site was established in the spring of 1999 and ran throughout the winter into this field season. Methane flux measurements were done using a modified aerodynamic gradient method using a special FID detector. The aerodynamic parameters were corrected with measurements made simultaneously from an eddy covariance system measuring CO2, H2O and energy exchange. Preliminary reports indicate a source of methane of 2.9 gCH4 m-2 for the dates between 12 June to 7 October, lower methane emissions compared to 1999, which had 6.6 gCH4 m-2.

18	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Toolik Lake Climate Station 1998-2011 and Lake E5 Climate Station (2000-present) data	"The Toolik Lake Climate Station is a floating climate station and should not be confused with the Toolik Field Station Climate site (TFS Climate Station or Met Station) which is a terrestrial station (located on land). Note that this land station has been called the ""Toolik Main Climate Station"", and the station on the lake is located where the main lake sampling site is located so it has also been called the Toolik Lake Main Climate Station. The meteorological station on the surface of Toolik Lake was first installed in the spring of 1998. Originally the station recorded air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. In 1999, a Kipp and Zonen CM3 radiation instrument was added to record the downwelling and upwelling of longwave and shortwave radiation. Measurements of all variables are taken at a 30 second interval, averaged every 5 minutes, and logged into a Campbell Scientific CR10x datalogger or starting in 2007 a Campbell CR1000 datalogger.

The meteorological station is anchored in place as soon as possible in June (when ice is off lake) and remains in place until the Land-Water group leaves in August. This station measures air temperature and relative humidity (with Vaisala HMP45C), wind speed and direction (with Met One 014A anemometer) and radiation (with CM3 Kipp and Zonen Radiometer). The longwave radiation is corrected for instrument case temperature. The wind sensor is ~ 3.8 meters above the water surface, and the temperature sensor is ~2.5 m above the water surface. The upwelling radiation sensors are located ~50 cm above the water surface. Lake E5 is a small 11.3 ha lake located Northwest of Toolik Lake Field Research StationThe Lake E5 climate station was installed in the spring of 2000. The Lake E5 climate station records air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Measurements are taken at a 30 second interval, averaged every 5 minutes, and logged into a Campbell Scientific CR10x datalogger. The meteorological station is anchored in place as soon as possible in June (when ice is off lake) and remains in place until the Land-Water group leaves in August. This station measures air temperature and relative humidity (with Vaisala HMP45C) at ~1.5 meters height above the lake surface, and wind speed and direction (with Met One 014A anemometer) at ~2 meters height above lake surface."

Tussock Watershed is a small inlet stream approximately 500 meters south of Toolik Lake (southwest of Toolik Field Station) that flows into Toolik Lake. 	For discharge measurement protocol, see the Land-Water protocol accessible from the Land-Water mainpage on the Arctic LTER web page or at http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gwk and clicking on the protocol link at the bottom of the page. Water level was recorded continuously with with a Stevens PGIII Pulse Generator connected to a Campbell Scientific CR510 datalogger. Additionally, we deployed a Campbell Scientific Model 247 Conductivity (EC) and Temperature probe which also recorded to the CR510. Discharge measurements were taken throughout each season to determine the stage-discharge relationship. When the stage heights exceed our range from the study year's rating curve, we apply a standardized composite rating curve (from 1991-2006) for Toolik Inlet to solve for stream discharge."

"Temperature and moisture profiles (to 40cm depth) in the Toolik watering plot experiment and the biannual thaw depth survey for the Tussock Watershed and Imnavait Creek catchment transect. 	Thaw depth has been measured in a small tussock tundra watershed near Toolik Lake on July 2nd and August 11th since 1990. Starting in 2003, thaw depth has been measured in the Imnavait Creek watershed on a weekly to biweekly basis during the summer season. The UTM stake grid (stakes are in a grid at every 100 meters) was used to locate the points. A ruled stainless steel rod was inserted in non tussock microhabitat until the frozen layer was reached, and the distance was measured to the top of the organic mat (beneath the uppermost moss). Two measurement were made at each point from 1990-1999, and three measurements were made at each point from 2000 on. All measured depths are in cm. Measurements are made within a 20 cm radius of each location point. All the measurements are then averaged into a single value for the day."

Lat 68 41'13"", long 149 05'42"", in NE1/2, sec.4, T.9 S., R.13E., on left bank 10 m downstream from culvert, at mile 297.9 Dalton Hwy, 14 mi south of Pump Station 3, and 16.5 mi upstream from mouth (USGS Hydrologic Unit 19060402) stage height measurements were taken hourly with a Campbell CR-10 datalogger, and continuously with the USGS Stevens chart recorder, at the USGS gauging station, 10 meters downstream of the the Dalton Highway crossing. Discharge measurements were taken with a Marsh McBirney flow meter at a location 20 meters below the chart recorder. Flow was measured at 20 points for each transect. Discharge measurements were used to calibrate the rating curves for each year. 	Temperature readings were taken every 10 minutes by a Campbell CR-10 datalogger located 10 m downstream from the Oksrukuyik Creek crossing. Discharge, stage height and temperarture were measured at the one km upstream of the Kuparuk River crossing at the Dalton Highway, 68 38'15""N, 149 25'30""W. Stage height measurements were recorded by a Campbell CR-10 datalogger positioned 1 km upstream of the Kuparuk River crossing at the Dalton Highway. Stage height readings are in centimeters from the bottom of the river to the water surface. Discharge calibration measurements were taken at 60% of depth at 20-30 points along a cross sectional transect of the river, 100 meters upstream of the datalogger. Raw data from the calibration measurements are available. Stream temperature and discharge Each summer, water temperature and stream discharge are determined for the Kuparuk River and Oksrukuyik Creek. In many years, temperature and stream height were recorded manually each day. In recent years, dataloggers have measured stream temperature and stream height at regular intervals. The Kuparuk River data is maintained by Doug Kane on the Water and Environmental Research Center at UAF (http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/NorthSlope/upper_kuparuk/uk_river/uk_river.html) Stream height is converted into stream discharge based on a rating curve calculated from manual discharge measurements throughout the season.

23	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Toolik Field Station Weather Station (aka Toolik Field Station Met) Data (1988-present)	Weather data has been collected at Toolik Field Station (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W) since June 1988. The weather station located at the field station was originally installed by the Arctic LTER (ecosystems.mbl.edu/arc) and TFS assumed control of the station in 2007. The field station is an ideal location for maintaining long-term weather data, as it is located in a data sparse region and adds a data point along the north-south transect of the Northslope of Alaska, following along the Dalton Highway. There is year round access and a long-term pre-existing dataset. These advantages make it possible to provide quality data - a often difficult achievement in remote northern latitudes in Alaska. Data collected includes air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, wind direction, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, precipitation, soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, precipitation and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. Most sensors are read every minute and then averaged or totaled every hour. The exceptions are soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature which are read on ten minute intervals and averaged every three hours. Pan evaporation and pan water temperature are only measured during the summer months. For photosynthetically active radiation sensor no attempt is made to correct for frost or snow on the sensors during the winter months. As of 2008, global solar radiation sensor is equipped with a heater and ventilation system to remain snow and frost free throughout the year. Years prior to 2008, the global solar radiation was not kept free from frost or snow. Please note this when viewing radiation data.

24	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Arctic Observing Network Study of Carbon and Energy Balances in Arctic Terrestrial Systems (Imnaviat Creek)	In order to develop a process-level understanding of carbon, water and energy exchanges throughout the circumpolar terrestrial Arctic, datasets from a variety of international projects must be readily available through an integrated public database. It is the intention of this site to provide this data from the projects that are associated with this particular aspect of Arctic Observatory Networks. It is expected that the availability and comparability of relevant datasets be enhanced and that communications and collaborations between international research projects will be improved. Therefore, this project is committed to the following: the collection, archiving and regular maintenance of publically available datasets; development of detailed metadata to aid in the understanding of these datasets; the posting of detailed information about study sites, present and past in formats that are understandable and useful to both researchers and the general public;  the timely display of data and imagery from active projects; the timely processing of data from active projects; fostering communication between researchers, students and the public through the posting of analyses, presentations, posters and publications. There are four automated weather stations deployed at Imnavait Creek in support of the AON objectives.  The primary stations consist of the Ridge and Fen stations which were deployed at the end of the summer, 2007. The Biocomplexity Tower -- this automated weather and gas analysis station was deployed in 2004 and has been in operation during the melt seasons ever since.

26	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Sagavanirktok River / Bullen Point Hydrology Project	This project, funded by the State of Alaska through the Department of Natural Resources (AKDNR), ended in July of 2010. The purpose of the project was to investigate the hydrology in the coastal plain region from the Sagavanirktok River toward Bullen Point. This is a data-sparse region; issues such as breakup timing, prediction of flood events, estimating potential recharge and impacts of water use from lakes and gravel pits require a better understanding of water resources in the area. It is also important to develop an understanding of how the related watersheds function relative to the Kuparuk River Watershed, which has the longest-term data on the North Slope and has the greatest potential for serving as an index watershed. Developing this understanding will help better define the risks associated with hydrologic variability and climate change impacts in areas with no historical hydrologic information.

27	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	Kuparuk Watershed Hydrology Study	Driven by the need to improve our understanding of the role that arctic hydrology plays in the regional and global climate, several related hydrologic studies were initiated on the North Slope of Alaska in 1992. These studies included field research and modeling studies of the logistically accessible Kuparuk River basin and selected contributing watersheds, a north draining river system that empties into the Arctic Ocean. The goals are to collect quality hydrologic data throughout the year, monitor and study as many hydrologic processes as possible, address issues of spatial variability, examine hydrologic responses at various scales, and utilize conventional as well as remote methods of data collection. The area of study is the Kuparuk River basin (8, 140 km2) and three smaller drainages: Upper Kuparuk River (142 km2), Imnavait Creek (2.2 km2) and Putuligayuk River on the coastal plain (471 km2).

28	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	North Slope Lakes Hydrology Project	The objective of the North Slope Lakes Project is to assess the physical and chemical hydrologic processes in North Slope Lakes and potential changes associated with water use. This project involves hydrological and meteorological montioring, remote sensing analysis, and numerical modeling. There are currently ten meteorological stations associated with this project and five neighboring stations associated with different Water and Environmental Resource Center projects. Observations, remote sensing imagery, and modeling are used to quantify water inputs and evaporative losses across the operational region of the North Slope. Extensive snow surveys prior to spring melt will allow us to characterize regional differences in snow distribution. Evaporation and evapotranspiration are empirically determined from meteorological measurements. We characterize available recharge for selected watersheds. These results will be combined to estimate the water balance of target lakes. The modeling and analysis efforts will develop a set of operational modeling tools for Industry and agencies to use for water use activities.	ISO-____

33	Permafrost/SoilTemperature	Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program 	The primary goal of the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program is to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change over long (multi-decadal) time scales.  The CALM program began in 1991. The CALM observational network observes the long-term response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to changes and variations in climate at more than 125 sites in both hemispheres. CALM currently has participants from 15 countries. It was initially affiliated with the International Tundra Experiment (www.itex-science.net) and was later (1998-2002) supported by a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Arctic System Science program to the University of Cincinnati and directed by Professor K. M. Hinkel. During a bridging year (2003) field operations in Alaska, Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan were supported by the University of Delaware’s Center for International Studies. The CALM program is currently supported by a grant from NSF’s Arctic Research Support and Logistics program (OPP-0352958). A brief history of CALM is available in Brown et al. (2000). Approximately 60 sites measure active-layer thickness on grids ranging from 1 ha to 1 km², and 100 sites observe soil temperatures, including permafrost temperatures from boreholes. Most sites in the CALM network are located in Arctic and Subarctic lowlands, although 20 boreholes affiliated with CALM are in mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere above 1300 m elevation. A new Antarctic component is being organized and currently includes 13 sites. The broader impacts of this project are derived from the hypothesis that widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes. The CALM website contains archived data sets, a table of summary statistics, a map of the sites, measurement protocols, CALM forms, equipment installation instructions, uploading and downloading instructions, and other pertinent information.

The GCOS and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) under the Terrestrial Observation Panel for Climate (TOPC) and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) have identified Permafrost Thermal State and Permafrost Active Layer as key variables for monitoring the cryosphere. Changes in permafrost temperatures frequently reflect changes in surface climate over time, and therefore serve as a useful indicator of climate change. A globally comprehensive permafrost monitoring network is required in order to detect and monitor spatial and temporal variability changes in active layer and permafrost. At its June 1998 Yellowknife, Canada meetings, the International Permafrost Association (IPA) Council passed two resolutions to facilitate development of a permafrost monitoring network and service. The IPA subsequently prepared strategy and implementation documents consistent with the GCOS monitoring observations. Development and implementation of the GTN-P is managed by the International Permafrost Association. Parts of the GTN-P are already in place through nationally and regionally funded projects. A 12-country, 80-site network presently exists under the IPA's Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) Network. Borehole temperatures are also measured at 33 of these active layer sites. About 200 boreholes of varying depths are potentially available for monitoring permafrost temperature changes. The European Community project, Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) has begun to instrument a series of nine boreholes in mountains from Spain and Italy to Svalbard. Final selection of borehole sites will be undertaken to ensure sound regional and global coverage, while taking maximum advantage of existing facilities. Site selection guidelines are under development. In addition sites will be selected to meet the GCOS/GTOS hierarchical system for surface observations, or the Global Hierarchical Observing Strategy (GHOST).

36	inlandWaters	Water Resources of the Colville River Special Area, National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (2003)	In July 2000, the BLM began a systematic inventory of the water resources of the Colville River Special Area, as recommended by the Record of Decision for the Northeast National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Integrated Activity Plan/Environmental Impact Statement. Six lakes and seventeen river sites were surveyed to provide baseline limnological and hydrological information for the Special Area. Field crews measured streamflow, surveyed channel geometry, and collected water quality samples. Drainage basins and their physical characteristics were determined using Geographic Information System analysis. A hydrologic basin map was produced. Flood frequency relationships and bankfull discharge were estimated using computer models. The basin characteristics, streamflow data, channel geometry, and water quality information will be used to characterize those areas subject to future management plans and mitigate potential disturbances in site-specific environmental analyses.

37	inlandWaters	Monthly Lake Chemistry and Physical Data for Selected North Slope, Alaska Lakes: 2002-2008, University of Alaska-Fairbanks Water and Environmental Research Center and Geo-Watersheds Scientific	The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Water and Environmental Research Center (WERC) and Geo-Watersheds Scientific (GWS), together with project cooperators, initiated a study in the Fall of 2002 (Phase One) to obtain baseline information about the physical and chemical characteristics of North Slope tundra lakes. The project was extended in 2005 (Phase Two). The location of the study lakes changed and was expanded to include other reservoirs so as to further develop the understanding and simulation tools necessary for water-source management. K113 is an un-pumped lake in the Kuparuk oilfield and is sampled on selected field trips during the year. L9312 is a natural lake studied in the Alpine operations area. L9817 is a natural lake in eastern NPRA, west of Nuiqsut. L9817 had been used in past years for ice-road construction, but was not pumped during the 2005-06 or 2006-07 winters, however, it was heavily pumped throughout the 2007-08 winter. Two reservoir systems (mine sites) were added to the study in 2005. Mine Site B, also known as Six-mile Lake, is located near the Milne Point facility at the intersection of the Spine Road with the Milne Point access road and has two cells connected to Milne Creek. The Kuparuk Reservoir System (Kuparuk Deadarm Lakes) has nine reservoirs. The three southernmost reservoir cells (1-3) are included in the study to observe ground-water and surface water interactions between each cells and the adjacent Kuparuk River. Water-quality and hydrologic data is collected in the field during monthly visits to the lakes and water samples are collected from priority locations for further analysis at the UAF-WERC chemistry laboratories.

41	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	University of Alaska-Fairbanks Central North Slope Snow Survey Data 1985 to 2010	University of Alaska-Fairbanks Water and Environmental Research Center (UAF WERC) snow survey data are from more than 150 sites in watersheds east of the Colville River to the western boundary of the Canning River basin, including the Chandler, Anaktuvuk, Itkillik, Kuparuk, Sagavanirktok, Kadleroshilik, Shaviovik, and Kavik River watersheds.  The southern and northern boundaries of the domain are 68 10 N and 70 15 N. The western and eastern boundaries of the domain are 150 00 W and 146 30 W. Elevation within the study area ranges from sea level to 2675 m (0 to 8025 ft). The topography is characterized by the flat coastal plain to the North and gentle rolling hills and valleys and mountain ridges of the Brooks Range to the south. Snow survey data include depth, snow water equivalent, and density for most sites and just snow water equivalent for others. Field studies conducted at the end of April are likely representative of all winter precipitation that has fallen (minus sublimation) from October to April. Snow surveys conducted in May and June are conducted to estimate ablation.  The longest period of record of SWE data in this dataset are from the Imnaviat Basin (1985 to 2010). Franklin Bluffs and Sagwon Hill surveys have been conducted since 1988, Betty Pingo surveys have been conducted since 1993, West Dock , Upper Kuparuk, and Happy Valley surveys since 1999. Other sites were established after 2000. Snow survey data collection was initiated by Larry Hinzman and Doug Kane. Since 2004 data collection has been conducted by Sveta Steufer and others. Methods for current snow surveys can be found in Berezovskaya et al 2009 and 2010. Methods for snow surveys conducted prior to 2006 need to be acquired and added to the database. Citations for historic snow surveys need to be added to the database as well. Note that the location of the Imnaviat Basin snow surveys has changed and needs to be updated in the database: from 1985 to 1988 snow surveys were conducted at four west-facing mid-basin sites, in 1989 they increased the number of sites surveyed to six mid-basin sites, and from 1999 to 2010 they have conducted snow surveys at six sites along a transect (UTM 612800 northing). Currently, data from all Imnaviat Basin sites are averaged and represented by one point. From 2005 to 2009, snow ablation measurements were partially supported by the WERC/UAF National Science Foundation project “Long-term measurements in the Kuparuk River Watershed”.	ISO-____	
43	climatology/meteorology/atmosphere	March, J. 2009. Synoptic climatology of the eastern Brooks Range, Alaska : a data legacy of the international geophysical year. University of Alaska-Fairbanks, Alaska, Thesis: 116 pages. 	Data from three International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) expeditions and one International Hydrological Decade National Science Foundation project (1969-1972) to the eastern Alaska North Slope have been rescued and made available in digital form: Chamberlain Glacier, Lake Peters, and McCall Glacier. Comparisons between these sites and US and Canadian Weather Service stations within 500km of McCall Glacier were conducted to determine the broad temperature climatology of the region. McCall Glacier is generally a swing site, and the climatology of the region often was linked most closely to the Beaufort Sea coast, though on some occasions, was more closely related to the Mackenzie River Delta and on other occasions, to the Interior. These early data represent an important addition to the Arctic data legacy by allowing a more complete climate record to be developed that focuses on a region demonstrably sensitive to climate change and yet lacking in data. Key words: glacier, meteorology, International Geophysical Year, Alaska, McCall Glacier, Brooks Range, data rescue.	ISO-____	
44	inlandWaters	Discharge in a drained thaw lake basin	Runoff measurements were collected from a 0.3 km^2 wetland as part of the biocomplexity experiment (this represents the control section of the experiment) in Barrow, Alaska. Runoff measurements were made with a flow meter (Flo-MateTM Model 2000, Marsh-McBirney) in early morning (low-flow) and early evening (high-flow) throughout the spring runoff period with simultaneous readings of water levels  (HOBO U20-001-04-Ti in 2009, and diurnal site visits in 2008 and 2007) to obtain a stage-discharge relationship.This work was funded by NSF, student grants from Gålö Foundation (Sweden), Sweden-America Foundation, Center for Global Change and Arctic System Research and the American Water Resources Foundation - Alaska Section.

46	inlandWaters	Biogeochemistry of a Treeline Watershed, Northwestern Alaska	Since 1950, mean annual temperatures in northwestern Alaska have increased. Change in forest floor and soil temperature or moisture could alter N mineralization rates, production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and organic nitrogen (DON), and their export to the aquatic ecosystem. In 1990, we began study of nutrient cycles in the 800-ha Asik watershed, located at treeline in the Noatak National Preserve, northwestern Alaska. This paper summarizes relationships between topographic aspect, soil temperature and moisture, inorganic and organic N pools, C pools, CO2 efflux, growing season net N mineralization rates, and stream water chemistry. Forest floor (O2) C/N ratios, C pools, temperature, and moisture were greater on south aspects. More rapid melt of the soil active layer (zone of annual freeze–thaw) and permafrost accounted for the higher moisture. The O2 C and N content were correlated with moisture, inorganic N pools, CO2 efflux, and inversely with temperature. Inorganic N pools were correlated with temperature and CO2 efflux. Net N mineralization rates were positive in early summer, and correlated with O2 moisture, temperature, and C and N pools. Net nitrification rates were inversely correlated with moisture, total C and N. The CO2 efflux increased with temperature and moisture, and was greater on south aspects. Stream ion concentrations declined and DOC increased with discharge. Stream inorganic nitrogen (DIN) output exceeded input by 70%.
